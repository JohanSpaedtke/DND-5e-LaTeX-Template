You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

\spell{Blessing of the Trickster}
{Divine power}
{\color{action} 1 action}
{Touch}
{--}
{Up to 1 hour}
Give a willing creature other than yourself advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.

\spell{Cloak of Shadows}
{Channel Divinity}
{\color{action} 1 action}
{Self}
{--}
{--}
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish.

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with poison?a gift from your deity. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

\spell{Invoke Duplicity}
{Channel Divinity}
{\color{action} 1 action}
{30 feet}
{--}
{Concentration, Up to 1 minute}
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate o f yourself.

As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion?s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

\spell{Turn Undead}
{Channel Divinity}
{\color{action} 1 action}
{30 feet}
{--}
{Up to 1 minute}
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can?t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can?t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there?s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 
for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely 
covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends 
if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

{1 round}
%
You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn?t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can?t follow your command, the spell ends.

\impact{Approach.} The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

\spell{Detect Evil and Good}
{1st-level divination}
{\color{action} 1 action}
{Self}
{V, S}
{Concentration, up to 10 minutes}
%
For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

\spell{Detect Magic}
{1st-level divination {\color{ritual}(ritual)}}
{\color{action} 1 action}
{Self}
{V, S}
{Concentration, up to 10 minutes}
%
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic
within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

\spell{Disguise Self}
{1st-level illusion}
{\color{action} 1 action}
{Self}
{V, S}
{1 hour}
%
You make yourself?including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person?look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can?t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spellto add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

{Concentration up to 10 minutes}
%
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can?t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball. If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.
\spell{Shield of Fate}
{1st-level abjuration}
{\color{bonusaction}1 bonus action}
{30 feet}
{V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of
holy text written on it)}

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Weal}, for good results
  \item \emph{Woe}, for bad results
  \item \emph{Weal and woe}, for both good and bad results
  \item \emph{Nothing}, for results that aren't especially good or bad
\end{itemize}
The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
Ifyou cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

{2nd-level necromancy}
{\color{action}1 action}
{30 feet}
{V}
{1 minute}

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward.

When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

{\color{action}1 action}
{Touch}
{V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)}
{Until dispelled}
