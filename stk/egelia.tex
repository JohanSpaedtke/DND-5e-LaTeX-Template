You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.

You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
	\item You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
	\item You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
	\item You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
	\item You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or win  dow to fly open or slam shut.
	\item You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.
\end{itemize}
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
